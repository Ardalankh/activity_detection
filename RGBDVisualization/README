Used for converting raw RGBD data into PNG files. Note that converting into PNG will
give you less precision, especially the depth data. Anything beyond 20 meters in depth
data has been scaled to same number 255. You can change MAX_DEPTH constant at the top
of the "main.cpp" to change the scaling of depth data.

<Requires>
1) C++ compiler
2) OpenCV

<Usage>
1) run "make"
2) run "./visualize <RGBD_FILE_NAME>"
    - replace the <RGBD_FILE_NAME> with the file that contains raw RGBD information.
3) resulting PNG files will be located under "out/<RGBD_FILE_NAME>" directory.
